This is to demonstrate how python can be used to access the MySQL database and make modifications as needed.
In particular, a interests database is created and then a table called the movies is created which has different fields and the rows of the table are filled by the inputs provided by the user 
Later the actual data in the database can be accessed all at once or by paramterized retrieval.
